description: Produces comprehensive Git commit messages (what and why) and, when authorized, stages and commits. By default stages only the current task/workflow scope, not unrelated user or other-agent changes; stage the whole tree only when the user explicitly asks or the parent workflow says so. After a successful commit (non-blocking), runs available package typecheck (if any) and a **lightweight** read of **HEAD** only (bug risks, god-module smells, needless complexity, duplication)—not a full **audit** (no grades, no multi-agent); for that, the user invokes the **`audit`** skill. Surfacing findings as optional heads-up, never as a reason to block or unwind the commit unless the user asks. No automatic fixes. Message-only requests use the same template without running git until commit is explicitly requested. Also use inside authorized workflows (for example execute-plan phase commits). Do not use for read-only review, hypothetical history, or when git writes are not authorized.

# Git Commit

## Purpose

Produce **reviewable commits**: a clear subject line and a body that explains
**what** changed and **why**. **Staging is scoped by default** so a commit does
not accidentally absorb unrelated dirty work from the user, tooling, or another
agent.

## Authority

- **`git commit` allowed when** the user explicitly asks you to commit, or a
  checked-in workflow skill (for example `execute-plan`) authorizes commits as
  part of its procedure.
- **Message text only** when the user wants a commit message but did **not**
  ask you to run Git: use the subject and body rules below, optionally after
  `git status` / `git diff` for context. Do **not** `git add` or `git commit`.
- If committing would be a surprise—no explicit commit request and no
  workflow granting commit authority—**stop** before `git commit` and confirm
  intent.

## Use When

- A commit with a strong message is requested or workflow-authorized.
- The user wants help composing commit message text (with or without you
  running `git commit`—see Authority).

## Do Not Use When

- Git writes are forbidden by context and nothing overrides that.

## Staging scope

- **Default (this skill alone):** Stage only the files that belong to the
  current task or explicitly requested commit scope. Use pathspec staging, not
  blind `git add -A`, when unrelated dirty files exist.
- **Whole-tree override:** Stage all tracked, deleted, and untracked files only
  when the user explicitly asks to commit everything, or a parent workflow
  explicitly requires a whole-tree commit. `.gitignore` still applies.
- **Parent workflow override:** If the active procedure **explicitly** limits
  what may be staged (for example `execute-plan` phase commits: only files for
  the completed phase), **follow that staging scope** and still use the message
  rules below.
- If `git status` shows something surprising (unexpected paths, credentials,
  huge artifacts), **surface it** before committing. Do not silently include
  unrelated work, and do not revert it.

## Procedure

1. **Inspect** full `git status` and `git diff` (and `git diff --staged` if
   anything is already staged). Understand **everything** that will be included.
2. **Stage** per [Staging scope](#staging-scope) above.
3. **Subject line** (about 50 characters target, 72 hard cap):
   - Imperative mood: "Add", "Fix", "Refactor" — not past tense ("Added",
     "Fixed") or third-person singular ("Adds", "Fixes") as the **subject**.
   - The **body** may include issue closers such as `Fixes #123` when that is the
     project convention.
   - Be specific about area or behavior, not "Update code" or "WIP".
4. **Body** (one blank line after the subject; wrap near 72 columns):
   - **What**: bullets or short paragraphs covering **all** substantive areas in
     this commit (not only the files you touched this turn).
   - **Why**: motivation, tradeoffs, what was broken or awkward, or why this
     approach over alternatives.
   - **Context** (optional): issue links, plan paths, or follow-ups when they
     help the next reader.
   - **Causal trailers** (optional): for hard-to-reverse architecture,
     cross-repo contracts, production migrations, security/auth boundaries, or
     memory-system policy, add concise trailers such as `Constraint:`,
     `Rejected:`, `Directive:`, and `Tested:`. Do not require trailers for tiny
     commits.
5. **Commit** (commit path only), for example in bash or zsh:
   - `git commit -m "subject" -m $'paragraph...\n\n- bullet'`
   - or `git commit` with an editor when the body is long.
6. **Verify** (commit path only): `git show --stat HEAD` matches intent (entire
   staged set landed).
7. **Post-commit audit** (commit path only): after the commit succeeds, follow
   [Post-commit audit](#post-commit-audit). Run package typecheck if a root `package.json` script exists; then
   scan **only** the `HEAD` diff for bug risks, god modules, needless complexity,
   and duplication (**lightweight**—see [What this is not](#what-this-is-not)).
   **Tell the user** about findings in the same turn (paths,
   severity, next step if obvious)—as **heads-up**, not scolding. The commit is
   already done; do **not** delay the commit, imply it was a mistake, or push
   amend/revert unless the user asks. Do **not** silently “fix” findings unless
   the user asked; surfacing is the goal. If everything passes and nothing
   worrisome stands out in the diff, you may omit commentary.

On the **message-only** path, perform step 1 as needed for context, skip
staging and steps 5–7, and output the subject and body (use the template
below).

## Message template

```text
Add/improve/fix <behavior> in <area>

What:
- ...

Why:
- ...

Tested: ...
```

## Post-commit audit

Run this **only after** `git commit` completes successfully (same repo, same
branch).

### Intent (non-blocking)

- **Commit always wins.** Nothing here vetoes, reorders, or shames a commit that
  already landed. People should keep committing; this step is **extra awareness**
  for the author, not policy for the team.
- **Alerts, not gates.** Typecheck or review findings are **heads-up** so you can
  fix forward (typecheck failed after commit—here is the output) or
  choose to ignore. Do not treat red typecheck as “the commit was wrong.”
- **Optional follow-up.** Suggest a fix commit or local cleanup only when helpful;
  never pressure amend/revert unless the user explicitly wants that.
- **Deeper review:** For **lint + tests**, **A–F grades**, optional **multi-agent**
  passes, and broader scope, the user should invoke the **`audit`** skill
  (message contains **`audit`**)—do not inflate post-commit into a full audit.

### What this is not

Stay **narrow** so commits stay fast:

- **Do** run available typecheck scripts when present, and read **`git show -p HEAD`** (this commit only).
- **Do not** run the full test suite, generated checks, or smoke tests here by
  default—those belong to **`audit`**, CI, or the repo's documented ship path unless the
  user’s task already called for them.

### Package / type checks

From the **repository root**:

- If `package.json` exists and defines `typecheck` / `check`, run that with the
  repo’s package manager.
- **Wordbreak default:** no `package.json` — skip and say so.

If the command is missing, dependencies are not installed, or the run fails,
**report the relevant output** with neutral framing. The commit stays.

### Diff scope

Use the committed change as the source of truth—e.g. `git show HEAD` or
`git show -p HEAD`, and the paths touched:
`git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD`.

### Bug scan

Re-read the change as a quick self-review **on changed lines only**. Flag **likely**
problems for the user (this is not a substitute for CI, **`audit`**, or the full
test suite unless already part of the task):

- Logic errors, wrong conditions, off-by-one, incorrect defaults.
- Missing or broken error handling / early returns where failures are plausible.
- Obvious regressions: removed guards, weakened validation, race or stale-state
  risks introduced by the new code.
- API or type mismatches, impossible states, or changes that contradict the
  commit message.
- **Async discipline (spot-check):** missing `await`, fire-and-forget promises,
  or ambiguous error propagation in the diff—borrowed from **`audit`** charter,
  but **only** what you see in this patch.
- **Persistence / game-loop (spot-check):** if the diff touches progress saving,
  fork routing, or curriculum↔runtime data, glance for obvious state bugs.
- **Security / privacy (glance):** obvious secrets in the diff; unsafe HTML
  construction if any — nudge toward **`audit`** if deeper review is needed.
- Anything that would make you say “wait, that can’t be right” on a PR.

### God module scan

Align with repo philosophy: **clear separation of concerns**, no dumping
unrelated responsibilities into one place.

Flag when this commit **creates or substantially grows** a module that looks
like a grab-bag “does everything” file—for example:

- **Size**: one file approaches or exceeds the project’s per-file size guidance
  (this repo aims for well under ~1000 LOC per file—use judgment near that
  band).
- **Scope creep**: unrelated domains, layers, or features fused into a single
  module (many disparate exports, orchestration + persistence + UI helpers in
  one file, etc.).
- **Fan-in smell**: a change that makes one file the obvious choke point for
  unrelated call sites when a split would be natural.

When in doubt, **flag lightly** with reasoning; avoid crying wolf, but do not
skip obvious smells to avoid bothering the user.

### Needless complexity and duplication

- **Needless complexity**: extra layers, over-abstraction, clever patterns where
  a straight line would do, new dependencies or infrastructure for trivial
  wins, configuration explosions, or branching that obscures the actual
  behavior—especially when it violates **simpler is better** for this repo.
- **Duplication**: copy-pasted blocks, parallel implementations of the same rule
  or transform, near-identical helpers that should be one function, or “another
  copy” of logic that already exists elsewhere—when unifying would obviously
  reduce drift risk.

Flag when this commit **introduces or worsens** these; cite paths and why it
matters.

### What to output

- **Typecheck / package scripts**: pass/fail/not run; if fail, enough output to act on.
- **If other issues**: short summary, bullet list with **file paths**, what you
  saw, and whether it looks like a definite bug vs. a risk vs. a maintainability
  smell.
- **If clean**: say nothing or one line—no boilerplate required.

## Anti-patterns

- One-word subjects ("fix", "wip", "updates").
- A body that only repeats the subject.
- **Blind whole-tree staging** when unrelated dirty files exist and no explicit
  whole-tree override was given.
- Claiming a “single logical change” while silently including co-present dirty
  files.
- **Skipping the post-commit audit** after a successful commit when this skill’s
  commit path ran—especially omitting available typecheck or staying silent when
  it fails or the diff clearly introduces risk.
- **Skipping typecheck** when the repo root has a usable typecheck script;
  hiding or summarizing away compiler errors instead of showing them.
- **Turning post-commit into a full audit:** running full
  test suites, multi-agent **`Task`** delegation, or **A–F grades** here—use the
  **`audit`** skill when the user says **`audit`**.
- **Blocking mindset:** implying the user should not have committed, or urging
  amend/revert, because of post-commit findings—unless they asked for that.

## Related skills

- **`audit`:** user message includes **`audit`**; lint, optional tests, optional
  multi-agent, **A–F** grades, broader scope.
- **Ship path:** when no package scripts/CI exist (Wordbreak default), a manual HTML smoke of the changed loop is enough.
