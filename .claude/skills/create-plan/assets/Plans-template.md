# [Feature Name] Plan

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Planned | In-Progress | Complete
**Progress model:** Phase task checkboxes only

> This template is the single source of truth for plans. Use the core sections below, and pull from Modules when needed. Delete anything unused.

## Executive Summary

One to three sentences: what we are building and why it matters. Include before and after metrics if applicable.

## Problem Statement

- **Symptom:** What users or developers experience.
- **Root Cause:** Why this keeps happening.
- **Impact:** Cost of inaction (errors, latency, dollars, time).

## Mode Definitions

Only include modes that change behavior or routing.

| Mode | Behavior | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Mode] | [What happens] | [Why this changes the plan] |

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

- [Specific, measurable outcome]
- [Specific, measurable outcome]

### Non-Goals

- [Deliberate exclusion and why]
- [Deliberate exclusion and why]

## Scope and Constraints

- **Scope:** What this plan includes.
- **Constraints:** Hard limits or dependencies.
- **Guardrails:** What must stay stable.

## Ground Truth Contracts (Do Not Violate)

- **[Contract]:** [Why this matters and what breaks if violated]
- **[Contract]:** [Why this matters and what breaks if violated]

## Already Shipped (Do Not Re-Solve)

- **[Component]:** [What it does, where it lives]
- **[Component]:** [What it does, where it lives]

## Fresh Baseline (Current State)

What exists today, with concrete data. Use this to anchor the plan.

- **Architecture:** [Short summary]
- **Metrics:** [Key numbers, p50/p95 if relevant]
- **Known gaps:** [What is missing]

## Solution Overview

High-level approach before diving into phases. Include a simple diagram if helpful.

```
+-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
| Component | --> | Component | --> | Component |
+-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
```

## Build vs Buy and Dependency Cost

- **Capability checked:** [What reusable problem we evaluated]
- **Candidates considered:** [Library A], [Library B], [Library C], or `None`
- **Decision:** Use library | Wrap library | Build from scratch
- **Why:** [Short rationale]
- **Dependency cost note:** [Bundle/runtime impact, transitive dependency risk,
  maintenance cost, lock-in risk, or `No new dependency`]

## Implementation Phases

> Do one phase at a time. Verify before proceeding.
>
> Each phase lists **Skills:** an implementer must read before starting.
> Reuse existing skills. Do not create a new skill per phase unless unique
> policy exists that no current skill covers. `execute-plan` and
> `phase-audit` apply to every phase; do not repeat them unless they are the
> only skills that phase needs.

## Critical Reminder

> SIMPLER IS BETTER. If you are adding complexity, justify it. Most of the time, the simplest solution wins.
